Quickstart
==========

StripePy is organized into a few subcommands:

* ``stripepy download``: download a minified sample dataset suitable to quickly test StripePy.
* ``stripepy call``: run the stripe detection algorithm and store the identified stripes in a ``.hdf5`` file.
* ``stripepy view``: take the ``result.hdf5`` file generated by ``stripepy call`` and extract stripes in BEDPE format.
* ``stripepy plot``: generate various kinds of plots to inspect the stripes identified by ``stripepy call``.

Walkthrough
-----------

The following is a synthetic example of a typical run of StripePy.
The steps outlined in this section assume that StripePy is running on a UNIX system.
Some commands may need a bit of tweaking to run on Windows.

1) Download a sample dataset (optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need to download the example matrix used here, you can do so by running:

.. code-block:: console

  user@dev:/tmp$ stripepy download --name 4DNFI9GMP2J8

Feel free to use your own interaction matrix instead of ``4DNFI9GMP2J8.mcool``. Please make sure the matrix is in ``.cool``, ``.mcool``, or ``.hic`` format.

A more extended description of the subcommand ``stripepy download`` is found in `Downloading sample datasets <./downloading_sample_datasets>`.

2) Detect architectural stripes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``stripepy call`` subcommand is the core of the analysis, designed to identify architectural stripes within contact
maps. This process can be quite time-consuming, especially when working with large files.

The path to your contact map file and the desired resolution are required to run the analysis. For instance, to analyse
the ``4DNFI9GMP2J8.mcool`` file at a 10,000 bp resolution, you would use:

.. code-block:: console

  user@dev:/tmp$ stripepy call 4DNFI9GMP2J8.mcool 10000

The command will output a single HDF5 file (e.g., ``4DNFI9GMP2J8.10000.hdf5``).

Additional information is provided in `Detect architectural stripes <./detect_stripes>`.


3) Fetch stripes in BEDPE format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stripe coordinates can be fetched from the ``.hdf5`` file using ``stripepy view``, as in

.. code-block:: console

  user@dev:/tmp$ stripepy view 4DNFI9GMP2J8.10000.hdf5 > stripes.bedpe

Further details can be found in `Fetch architectural stripes <./fetch_stripes>`.

4) Quickly visualize architectural stripes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is often a good idea to visually inspect at least some of the stripes to make sure that the used parameters are suitable for the dataset that was given to ``stripepy call``.

We provide a Jupyter notebook :download:`visualize_stripes_with_highlass.ipynb <../utils/visualize_stripes_with_highlass.ipynb>` to facilitate this visual inspection.
The notebook expects the input file to be in ``.mcool`` format.

More info available at `Visualize architectural stripes <./visualize_stripes>`.


Generating plots
----------------

StripePy comes with a ``plot`` subcommand that can be used to visualize architectural stripes overlaid on top of the
Hi-C matrix. ``stripepy plot`` can also generate several graphs showing the general properties of the called stripes,
see `Generating plots <./generate_plots>`.
