Detect architectural stripes
============================

The `stripepy_call_help` command serves as the main component within StripePy, and may take several minutes to complete when processing large files.

Positional arguments
--------------------

The command mandates two positional arguments:
  * ``contact_map``, which specifies the path to the input Hi-C file (in .cool, .mcool, or .hic format).
  * ``resolution``, which represents the resolution (in base pairs) at which the analysis should be run.

For instance, to run the command on a file named ``4DNFI9GMP2J8.mcool`` at a resolution of 10,000 bp, you would use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

  user@dev:/tmp$ stripepy call 4DNFI9GMP2J8.mcool 10000

Running the above command produces a similar output, here truncated for the sake of brevity:

.. code-block:: text

Upon successful completion, the above command will generate a single HDF5 file named ``4DNFI9GMP2J8.10000.hdf5`` in the current working directory.
Note that, if the HDF5 already exists, it will be overwritten if and only if the ``--force`` flag is specified; otherwise, the command will fail to prevent accidental data loss.

Output and logging configuration
--------------------------------

By default, the output HDF5 file is named after the input matrix file with the resolution appended, for example, ``4DNFI9GMP2J8.10000.hdf5``.
However, you have the flexibility to specify an alternative output path and filename for this HDF5 file using the ``--output-file`` option.

Furthermore, it is possible to save the complete log of a run to a file by specifying the path where to store the log file through the ``--log-file`` CLI option.

Stripe detection parameters
---------------------------

Beyond these arguments, `stripepy_call_help` comes with a suite of optional parameters for fine-tuning the stripe detection process. For a full understanding of their meaning, the user is referred to our `paper <https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaf351>`_.

Step 1: pre-processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can apply a specific ``--normalization`` method when fetching the contact map data from the input file; by default, no normalization is applied.
As found in our experiments, our algorithm performs optimally when no prior balancing is applied (see the `Supplementary Information <https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/41/6/btaf351/8161567#524807912>`_ from our paper).

The ``--genomic-belt`` option defines a radial band around the main diagonal of the contact map, specified in base pairs, to which the stripe search is confined; its default value is 5 Mbp.

Step 2: line detection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``--glob-pers-min`` option sets a critical threshold value between 0 and 1 (defaulting to 0.04).
This threshold is instrumental in filtering persistence maxima points for the global pseudo-distribution, which are crucial for identifying initial candidate stripe locations, frequently referred to as "seeds".

Step 3: shape analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The maximum permissible stripe width can be explicitly controlled using the ``--max-width`` option, which is specified in base pairs and defaults to 100,000 bp.

The height of a stripe can be constrained by studying a local pseudo-distribution via two alternative criteria:

* One criterion involves direct thresholding the local pseudo-distribution to a minimum value, specified via the option ``--loc-trend-min``, which should be set between 0 and 1 (defaulting to 0.25).
  A higher value for this parameter generally results in the detection of shorter stripes.
* Alternatively, the algorithm applies topological persistence to the local pseudo-distribution to identify persistent peaks.
  The location of the furthest identified peak is then used as a boundary for the stripe.
  This approach is engaged when the ``--constrain-heights`` flag is activated, which instructs the algorithm to utilize peaks within the local pseudo-distribution for height estimation.
  When ``--constrain-heights`` is active, the ``--loc-pers-min`` option acts as a threshold value between 0 and 1 (defaulting to 0.33) used to identify signal peaks within a horizontal domain when estimating the height of a stripe.
  If no persistent maximum other than the global maximum is found by the algorithm, the previous criterion is run.

Step 4: signal analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``--k-neighbour`` option allows you to define 'k' for the k-neighbours: it represents the number of bins that are considered adjacent to the stripe boundaries on both sides, with a default value of 3.
It is used to compute various signal descriptors, such as the relative change parameter.


Diagnostic plots generation
---------------------------

The command `stripepy_call_help` can generate several diagnostic plots that can be of help to gain more insights into the decisions made by the tool.

To generate the diagnostic plots, pass ``--roi=middle`` and specify the path to a folder where to store the plots using ``--plot-dir``.
The ``--roi`` option requires you to specify a criterion (``start`` or ``middle``) to select a representative region from each chromosome for plot generation.
Concurrently, the ``--plot-dir`` option designates the path to a directory where these output plots will be stored.
It is important to note that the ``--plot-dir`` option is mandatory when ``--roi`` is specified and is otherwise ignored.
If the specified directory does not exist at the time of execution, ``stripepy`` will automatically create it.

Performance options
-------------------

When processing larger Hi-C matrix, StripePy can take advantage of multicore processors.

The maximum number of CPU cores use by StripePy can be changed through option ``--nproc`` (set to 1 core by default).

Whenever possible, we recommend using 4-8 CPU cores. Using more than 8 CPU cores is unlikely to result in significantly better computational performance (that is unless your Hi-C dataset is particularly dense).
